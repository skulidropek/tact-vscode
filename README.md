## Error highlighting

Error highlighting can be enabled or disabled using user settings. Also a default delay is implemented for all the validations compilation as Tact compilation can be slow when you have many dependencies. This part uses Tact compiler to show errors and works by save event.

```
"tact.enabledAsYouTypeCompilationErrorCheck": true,
"tact.validationDelay": 1500
```

## Additional information by hover event
